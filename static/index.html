                <h2>Who I am ?</h2>
                <p>
                    I am currently studying general engineering in the French engineering school ECAM Lyon. 
                    It is actually my 4th year Bachelor and I was supposed to do a semester abroad in ITMO Univeristy in Saint Petersburg 
                    but I had to come back to France in the beginning of march. 
                </p>
